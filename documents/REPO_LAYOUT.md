# Repository Layout (repo-runner)

This document defines the expected folder structure for the repo-runner repository itself. The goal is to keep specs stable, implementation modular, and outputs reproducible.

## Top-Level Layout

/
  README.md
  ARCHITECTURE.md
  SNAPSHOT_SPEC.md
  ID_SPEC.md
  CONFIG_SPEC.md
  DETERMINISM_RULES.md

  src/
  tests/
  fixtures/
  scripts/
  dist/                (optional; build output if applicable)
  .gitignore
  LICENSE              (optional)

## Directory Purposes

### src/
Implementation code lives here.

Recommended internal modules (names are suggestions, not mandates):
- src/scanner/
- src/normalize/
- src/fingerprint/
- src/structure/
- src/snapshot/
- src/exporters/
- src/cli/

Rules:
- Keep phase boundaries clean.
- Do not mix exporters with canonical snapshot writing.

### tests/
Automated tests.

Suggested structure:
- tests/unit/
- tests/integration/
- tests/golden/

Golden tests should compare normalized outputs with snapshot_id/timestamp removed or ignored.

### fixtures/
Small, version-controlled fixture repos for testing.

Examples:
- fixtures/tiny_ts_repo/
- fixtures/mixed_repo/
- fixtures/windows_path_edgecases/

Rules:
- Fixtures must be small enough to run in CI quickly.
- Fixtures should include “annoying” cases (nested dirs, ignored dirs, mixed extensions).

### scripts/
Developer utilities and runner scripts.

Examples:
- scripts/run_fixture_tests.ps1
- scripts/run_fixture_tests.sh
- scripts/dev_snapshot.ps1

Rules:
- scripts/ must never be required for core functionality; they are convenience only.

### dist/ (optional)
Build artifacts if using a compiled language or bundler.

Rules:
- dist/ is never committed unless explicitly desired.
- dist/ should be ignored by git by default.

## Output Location Policy

Repo-runner should never write snapshots into its own repository by default.

Instead:
- Default output root should be user-specified, or
- A safe default like: {repo_root}/.repo-runner/ (for scanned repos), not the tool repo.

## Spec Discipline

All canonical contracts are the spec documents at repo root:
- SNAPSHOT_SPEC.md
- ID_SPEC.md
- CONFIG_SPEC.md
- DETERMINISM_RULES.md
- VERSIONING_POLICY.md

Implementation must follow specs. If implementation needs to change behavior, update specs first.

## Dennis Integration Boundary

Repo-runner is a standalone tool. Dennis consumes outputs.

Repo-runner must not:
- depend on Dennis code
- embed Dennis paths
- assume Dennis runtime environment beyond “local filesystem + CLI execution”

Dennis-specific orchestration belongs in Dennis.
